# Dinosorter
This is a simple sorting algorithm for comparing measurements the user inputs to those of certain Theropods -- the data being used is in config.
Measurements are compared to established data by adding the magnitudes of the differences between inputted measurements and those of each Theropod in the data set.

This was made for a specific project with a specific data set and is likely not suitable for universal use, this page exists just to make the source code available.
